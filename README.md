# FriendFinder

## What the project does
  * This application is a fun way to find friends who are compatible with you. Thus the name 'Friend Finder'. The user submits a survey and based on their answers is linked to another user with like answers. 

## Why the project is useful
  * One of the hardest things about being an adult is friendships. Many adults find it hard to branch out and meet new people. This app helps solve this problem and is a good first step to meeting new people also looking friends. 

## How users can get started with the project
  * Friend finder is very straight-forward and easy for user's to use. The home page has a 'Start Survey' button. Once clicked, the user must enter their name and a link to their profile picture. For every question they must select a number based on if they agree or strongly disagree with the question. After they answer the questions truthfully, hit the submit button and the user will be matched with their soul-friend!
